- 👋 Hi, I’m @ashesdroid
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Low-code, No-code, C++, web design, mobile app design, video games, and mental health.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Mobile app programing and C++ for games. I want to make a 2D artstyle game similar to Stardew Valley, but NOT Stardew Valley.
        I want to be original, but like the art style and telling a story through games. I am also working on a no-code Choices story game for a side project - kind of like
        a "Choose your own adventure" book.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Currently nothing. I like to get my feet wet first, learn basics on my own or by doing research. When I can understand
        a topic enough so that someone doesn't have to explain every detail - then I don't mind working with other people.
- 📫 How to reach me ... at this time; please don't. I'm lurking and I like it that way. lol
